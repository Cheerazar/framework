# Publishing your component

You've developed your component locally, and it's looking just about ready for primetime. But how do you make it available to other developers so they can use your component in their own app?

While Famous Framework is in beta phase, the simplest thing to do is to commit your component to the `components` folder (following the naming convention there), and push the change up to GitHub. Other developers will then be free to clone down your components and use them while developing locally.

In the (near) future, components will be hosted on Famous Hub, with access restriction, etc., so you can share your component without needing to use this workflow.
