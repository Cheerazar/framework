#Famous Framework Guides

Welcome to the Famous Framework guides. These guides will teach you how to build more consistent, modular, and extensible Famous applications and widgets using the Famous Framework.

##Introduction

The Famous Framework is an open-source JavaScript framework that was created to work hand-in-hand with the [Famous Engine](famous.org/learn), Famous studio tools (soon to come), and Famous cloud services (also soon to come).

The frameworkâ€™s architecture is based on a pattern we call BEST, which stands for behavior event state tree. We think of BEST as an evolution from MVC where data flows in one direction and concerns are better separated to accommodate dynamic user input and program events. Visit the [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md) section to learn more about the theory behind BEST. 

##Start learning

We suggest visting the [Hello Framework](HelloFramework.md) section first and then working your way down the navigation pane. If you'd like to dive straight into a new Framework seed project visit the [getting started](getting-started.md) section. The guides are organized to start at the basics and then gradually increase in complexity as you move towards the bottom of the navigation pane.

 If you're stuck, head over to our slack channel ([see: the Support section for details](famous.org/support) ) or shoot us an email at [learn@famo.us](mailto:learn@famo.us) with any questions, comments or concerns.
