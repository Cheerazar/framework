#Famous Framework Guides

Welcome to the Famous Framework guides. The Famous Framework is a new JavaScript framework for creating reusable, composable, and interchangeable UI widgets and applications. It's declarative, functional, and built on the [Famous Engine](https://github.com/Famous/engine). We are excited to make it available as open source under an MIT license for the first time as part of an early public beta.


##Introduction

The Famous Framework is an open-source JavaScript framework that was created to work hand-in-hand with the [Famous Engine](famous.org/learn), Famous studio tools (soon to come), and Famous cloud services (also soon to come).

The frameworkâ€™s architecture is based on a pattern we call BEST, which stands for behavior event state tree. We think of BEST as an evolution from MVC where data flows in one direction and concerns are better separated to accommodate dynamic user input and program events. Visit the [Core Concepts](core-concepts.md) section to learn more about the theory behind BEST. 

##Start learning

To get started, visit the [download & install section](getting-started.md) or jump straight into the [Hello Framework](HelloFramework.md) section. The sections are organized to start at the basics and then gradually increase in complexity as you move towards the bottom of the navigation pane.

 If you're stuck, head over to our slack channel ([see: the Support section for details](famous.org/support) ) or shoot us an email at [learn@famo.us](mailto:learn@famo.us) with any questions, comments or concerns.
