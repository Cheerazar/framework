##Trees

Trees structure an applicationâ€™s elements in an ordered heirarchy. They are a declarative representation of the Famous Scene Graph. Each module has only one tree, which can be represented by XML:

	<!-- or subsitute with your structure language of choice -->
	<view>
	    <surface></surface>
	</view>

- no logic in trees, departure from other frameworks. Control flow is done in [behaviors](behaviors.md)
- representation of scene graph
- Adding content in behaviors
