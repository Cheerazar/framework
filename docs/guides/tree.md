# Tree

The `tree` defines the structure of an applicationâ€™s elements in an ordered hierarchy. Ultimately, it represents the structure of the scene graph that will be created by the Famous Engine. Each component has only one tree, which can be represented using HTML syntax:

	<node>
	    <node></node>
	</node>
