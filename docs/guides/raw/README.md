A library of prose guides about the Famous Framework.

## Introduction

The Famous Framework is an [open-source JavaScript framework](https://github.com/Famous/framework) that was created to work hand-in-hand with the [Famous Engine](https://github.com/Famous/engine), Famous studio tools (soon to come), and Famous cloud services (also soon to come).

The framework's architecture is based on a pattern we call _BEST_, which stands for _behavior_ _event_ _state_ _tree_. We think of BEST as an evolution from MVC that is more geared toward building consistent, modular, and extensible applications.
