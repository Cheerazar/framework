<!-- since this DOM is for populating our virtual render tree and not for rendering directly in clients, we may be able to bypass the traditional rules of what can be rendered in the browser, e.g. by using periods in the tag names.  We need to ensure that selector operations still work within the virtual DOM representations across browsers, because we still use this to attach behaviors to virtual render trees at runtime using the querySelectorAll API. -->

<!-- can API elements just be included at the top level of a module, sort of like imports?  since their load/error events should be accessible to the module globally, and since those events are the only way to hook into their data payloads, this seems like the most elegant approach. -->
<!-- TODO:  flesh out what the definition of an API adapter looks like.  It should be a renderless module. -->

    click event that comes from this subtree.  This includes GL and DOM
    events.  The library is responsible for piping these events together
    for the end developer. (this would be like automatically piping the
    events from all child surfaces to a scrollview.)  We should also
    support stopPropagation to allow a user to stop events
    from bubbling upwards, which is a blacklist vs whitelist model
    of event piping (probably a bit more maintainable than the Famo.us 0.3 whitelist piping model.) -->
