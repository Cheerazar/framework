# Famous Framework

The Famous Framework is a JavaScript framework for creating expressive UIs, reusable components, and maintainable applications. It offers a clean, declarative syntax for harnessing the high-performance rendering capabilities of the [Famous Engine](https://github.com/Famous/engine) in both DOM and WebGL, plus some powerful constraints that help keep your code clear and plug-in-able.
